# CO-456-Anti-Chess
CO 456 Anti-Chess Final Project

This bot uses the Python Chess library which can be found at https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ .
Python Chess installation details are on the site.

For our UI we are using the pygame library which can be found at https://www.pygame.org/news .

Type the commands
```
pip install chess
pip install pygame
```

to install the libraries.


To run the program, in the command line type:

```
python3 antiChessBot.py white
```

or 

```
python3 antiChessBot.py black
```

where the bot will play on the side of the colour in the command line
